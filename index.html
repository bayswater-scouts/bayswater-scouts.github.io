      <p>The 2nd/3rd Bayswater Scout Group not only welcomes you into our family but also into the worldwide Scouting Movement.</p>
      <p>Our Group, together with every other Group in the municipality, is part of the City of Knox District. Perspective members are free to join any Group in their area, but it is best to join a Group as local as possible.</p>
      <p>Scouting is a worldwide movement with over 40 million members in 180 countries. All Scouts, regardless of colour, race or religion, make the Scout Promise and share the ideals originally inspired by the founder of Scouting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell,_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell" target="_blank">Baden-Powell of Gilwell</a>, over 100 years ago.</p>
      <p>Today, Scouting is the world's largest youth organisation, and your child has become a member of our Group, but that is not all, you, their parents or guardians, have joined our movement as well. Scouting is a cooperative community venture, sharing with family, school, and spiritual groups the task of building the character of the young - and you, the parents, are just as involved as your child.</p>

      <p style="font-style:italic;">"I always had lots of fun in Venturers. I met most of my long-term friends there. Of course I learned to fly through the Scouts. My Scouting experience helped me to develop leadership skills self-confidence and the ability to think laterally. It has helped me to deal with the different kinds of people I work with on theflight deck or the ground crew.”</p><p style="text-align: right;"> &mdash;Georgina Sutton<br>Qantas Fleet Captain</p>
