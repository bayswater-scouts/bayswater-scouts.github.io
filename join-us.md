Scouting is open to boys and girls of all ages, and we are always open to anyone that wants to come along and try it out!

To enquire about joining 2nd/3rd Bayswater Scouts, please <a href="mailto:gl.2nd3rdbayswater@vicscouts.com.au">email our Group Leader</a>, Jon Franklin or call on (03) 9762 5547. You may also wish to see our frequently asked questions section below.

### How much does it cost? ###

We offer a free trial while your child tries out Scouts and decides if they want to join us.

Once your child joins us, there are several fees to be paid. We do have flexible payment plans available, as it is our position that no child should miss out on Scouting due to financial hardship.

* **Scouts Victoria Membership Fee:** This fee goes towards things like insurance, compliance, and the professional support staff at Scouts Victoria.
* **2nd/3rd Bayswater Group Fee:** This fee goes towards things like our power and water bills, Group equipment, and Leader training. 
* **Maintenance Levy:** This levy is charged on a per-family basis. It is a contribution to the upkeep of our hall, and is refunded to those families who contribute to our working bees, which are held twice a year.
* **Subs:** This is a small fee charged each term for supplies used during weekly meetings.

There are additional charges for camps and some out of hall activities, and discounts for the children of our volunteer leaders.

### What safeguards are in place to protect my child? ###

Scouts Victoria is a Child Safe organisation. We are inclusive of all, regardless of their gender, sexuality, race, religion, or abilities, and do not tolerate any form of harm, abuse or neglect.

All of our adult members (anyone registered as a member and over the age of 18) are required to hold a Working With Children Check. This includes Leaders, Rover Scouts, Adult Helpers, and committee members.

For more information, visit Scouts Victoria's <a href="http://www.vicscouts.com.au/about-us/child-safe-scouting.html" target="_blank">Child Safe Scouting</a> page.

### What is the Uniform? ###

A shirt and optional belt is all that makes up the basic Scout uniform. These items can be purchased online from <a href="https://scoutshop.com.au/" target="_blank">The Scouts Shop</a>, or from the Snowgum Factory Outlet in Oakleigh East.

Other Scouting apparel (hats, windcheaters, etc.) is available for purchase, but is not required.

### Does my child need to purchase special outdoor equipment? ###

No. Our Group has access to a large range of camping and adventure equipment such as tents, ropes, canoes, and cooking gear. The cost of this equipment is met through our fundraising and Group Fees. 

As your child gets older, this kind of equipment makes for excellent birthday and christmas presents.

### How often do Scouts go camping? ###

Camping is an essential part of the Scouting program – and its lots of fun too. Camping is introduced at age appropriate levels and frequencies. Joey Scouts and Cub Scouts have sleepovers in the Scout Hall and Family Camps in tents. Scouts, Venturer Scouts and Rovers experience camping in tents and under canvas in the great outdoors.

### What if my child has a medical condition, such as asthma or diabetes? ###

When you first meet with the Section Leader, it’s very important to discuss any medical conditions that your child has. Leaders have access to training to support children with many types of medical conditions. With the correct information, Leaders can plan strategies to deal with medical issues.

### Where are you? ###

Our Scout Hall is located at the corner of Station Street and Bayswater Road, Bayswater.
