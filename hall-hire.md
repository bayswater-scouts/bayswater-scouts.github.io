Located just 300 metres from Baywater Railway Station, our hall is available for short and long term hire to local community groups, schools and businesses. We have a small carpark, but is plenty of good parking available at the adjacent railway station.

The main hall area is approximately 25 metres by 10 metres, with a timber floor and a large grassed & shaded area at the entrance. 

The main hall is wheelchair and pram accessible. It sits 100 people comfortably, and with tables can still seat over 90 people.
