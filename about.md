2nd/3rd Bayswater Scout Group is one of two Scout Groups in Bayswater, and we have been part of the local community for over fifty years. We are an active and dynamic group, with members ranging in age from 6 to 25. 

Our Group prides itself in encouraging the *out* in Scouting, with many activities taking place outside the Scout Hall. 

As Scouts, our mission is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.

Scouts are separated into age-based Sections, with each Section taking more responsibility for their own activities as they progress. All Sections share a steady diet of self-respect, confidence, leadership, teamwork, creativity, environmental awareness and community involvement, and there are plenty of events and activities in which everyone can get involved together.

<p style="font-style:italic;">Boys and girls aged 6 and 7.</p>

The Joey Scout theme is "Help other People" (H.O.P.). Joeys learn about sharing, caring, nature and the world around them.

The highest award for a Joey Scout is the Promise Challenge.

Our Joey Mob meets on Wednesday afternoons during school terms, from 5:00pm to 6:00pm.

<h2 style="color:#ffc82e; margin-bottom:0;">Cub Scouts &mdash; Fun from the start</h2>
<p style="font-style:italic;">Boys and girls aged 8 to 10.</p>

Cub-Scouts have great fun doing a lot of interesting things!!  There are games to play, codes and skills to learn , places to see and new friends to meet.

The highest award for a Cub Scout is the Grey Wolf Award.

Our Cub Scout Pack meets on Wednesday evenings during school terms, from 7:00pm to 8:30pm.

<h2 style="color:#00ae42; margin-bottom:0;">Scouts &mdash; The action of achieving</h2>
<p style="font-style:italic;">Boys and girls aged 11 to 14.</p>

When you become a Scout, you're accepting a challenge to plunge into action.  Scouts aren't told what to do by adults.  The Scout Leaders are there to help give direction but the Scouts are involved with planning the activities and making the decisions with other members of the Troop.

The highest award for a Scout is the Australian Scout Medallion.

Our Scout Troop meets on Thursday evenings during school terms, from 7:30 to 9:30pm.

<h2 style="color:#9e1b32; margin-bottom:0;">Venturers &mdash; Widen your horizons</h2>
<p style="font-style:italic;">Young men and women aged 15 to 17.</p>

In Venturers you will be able to discover your place in the adult world, and take part in a wide range of adventurous activities &mdash; for example last year our Unit went parascending, gliding, cross country skiing, hiking and canoeing.  The Venturers also organised a live band night and a 2 week 4WD expedition to the remotest areas of Australia.

The highest award for a Venturer Scout is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Scout" target="_blank">Queen's Scout Award</a>.

The Stringybark Venturer Unit meets on Friday nights during school terms, from 8pm to 10pm.

<h2 style="color:#dc291e; margin-bottom:0;">Rovers &mdash; A challenge to succeed</h2>
<p style="font-style:italic;">Young men and women aged 18 to 25.</p>

Are you prepared to push your mind and body to the limit?  If you're ready to accept that challenge, Rovers is for you.

In Rovers, you can do anything you set your mind to. Hike the Larrapinta Trail in central Australia? Go camping for a few weeks in eastern Canada? Build a race car? All of these things and many, many more have been done by our Rovers.

The highest awards for a Rover Scout are the <a href="http://www.vicrovers.com.au/awards/baden-powell" target="_blank">Baden-Powell Scout Award</a> and <a href="http://www.vicrovers.com.au/awards/wf-waters" target="_blank">WF Waters Rover Service Award</a>.

<h2 style="margin-bottom:0;">Adult Supporters</h2>
<p style="font-style:italic;">Men and women aged 18 and over.</p>

We couldnâ€™t provide such amazing experiences for young people without our dedicated and enthusiastic adult volunteers. 

There are plenty of flexible ways adults can get involved with or contribute to our Group without making the time commitment required for a uniformed leadership role.

Our **Leaders** focus on planning and running activities, and providing youth members with the best possible Scouting experience.

The **Group Support Committee** focuses on administration and fundraising, and ensuring that the Group has everything we need to deliver a quality Scouting experience for all our members.

**Adult Helpers** A step beyond the invaluable support provided by the "average parent," Adult Helpers occasionally assist with activities, or food preparation on Joey Scout and Cub Scout activities.

**Parents** are also an important part of our Group Family. From simple things like providing transport to camps and helping with fundraising, to helping with the maintenance of our hall and equipment, our parents are an essential part of the Group.
